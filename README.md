# Atlantia-EPICS
Atlantia EPICS Javascript Code

This code is designed to be a boilerplate for future iterations in the Atalantia project.
It uses the Three.js Javascript framework to generate and interact with 3D objects on a website.
It uses the Javascript SDK for Leap Motion sensor to interface with the sensor in a web browser.

#Some future possible developments:
  Break up the javascript code into separate modules and host on nodejs.
  Generate logic to detect point and palm grabs and proximity of hand objects and other 3D objects on scene to increase the interactivity.
  Add physics
